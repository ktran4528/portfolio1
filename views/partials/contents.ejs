          <p>Hello! My name is Kevin Tran. I am currently enrolled in "Software Engineering Technology" at Centennial College and in 3rd semester.
          I started programming in grade 10 starting with visual basic, as time went on I learned more about coding and langauges through highschool and
          doing my own research and learning outside of school. After grade 10 in school I did java in grade 11 and grade 12. In grade 11 is when I
          decided I wanted to go into a field that involved programming because I found it to be fun. In Centennial college it have fell more in love
          with programming because they have given me the chance to code with others and learn some subjects more in dept then I could teach myself
          I have learned on my own time they I will most likely want to become mobile dev because the most fun ive had learning a on my own so far
          was when I was trying to learn kotlin in summer of 2021. So far some langauges that I have learned and  trying doing are Java, C#, HTML, CSS. 
          Javascript, Sql, and some kotlin</p>
          <p>some things I enjoy doing on my free time is playing games and watching shows. When I am on my freetime I tend to
          think about some real world issues I could try solving with code usally they don't go well because I lack the knowledge of how to
          do certain things but whenever I try and code somthing new it is always a nice learning expirece and is fun.</p>
